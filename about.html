        <p class="about">Mr. WorldWide Eats was founded by Davis Murrell, a young chef with a passion for food 
            and for learning about various cultures. He has spent years learning the ins-and-outs of cooking
            styles from Japan to Mexico to Italy. He is currently seventeen years old. His passion 
            for cooking stems from his love for food shows and from helping his parents cook ever since
            he could hold a spatula. Further, as a cancer survivor, he wants to bring more joy into the world 
            wherever he can.
